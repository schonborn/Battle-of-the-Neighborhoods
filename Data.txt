Data

Foursquare will be used for locating current Indian/Thai restaurants.  It will also show which other types of restaurants (and how many) are in the area.  There was no online listing of neighborhoods and coordinates that I could find.  So I made a file manually.  Initially, I made a file for the whole county, but since the county is a mix of a very small urban area, suburbs, and rural areas, the sizes of the neighborhoods made comparison difficult.  The rural zip code/neighborhood is about 150 square miles, whereas typical suburban neighborhoods are 5 square miles.  Fortunately, the City of Port Saint Lucie recently started dividing the city into neighborhoods (https://www.cityofpsl.com/government/departments/neighborhood-services/nice-program/neighborhoods#:~:text=Neighborhoods%20%20%20%20Neighborhood%20%20%20,community%20wit%20...%20%2026%20more%20rows%20).  I decided to focus on Port Saint Lucie.  The maps are shown on the webpage and I used Google Earth Pro to find the approximate centers of them.
